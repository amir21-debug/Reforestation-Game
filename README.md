# Reforestation Game

This is an educational game developed by a team of 5 students during our university software engineering course, with myself as team leader. I led the project development in collaboration with Innov8 Africa, an organization that works directly with students in Kenya to promote innovation and environmental education.

The purpose of this game is to teach children how to protect, restore, and sustain forests through interactive gameplay.


## Project Background

Innov8 Africa presented the project idea to our software engineering class. Their team works directly with Kenyan students, and my team and I developed the game to support their mission of environmental awareness and hands-on learning.

## Game Objectives

- Educate students on the effects of deforestation and the importance of reforestation
- Promote environmental stewardship through engaging activities
- Provide an interactive platform for learning how to care for a forest ecosystem
